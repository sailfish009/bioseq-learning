      "|   0 | gnl|CDD|276832 cd01381, MYSc_Myo7, class VII myosin, motor domain.  These monomeric myosins have been associated with functions in sensory systems such as vision and hearing. Mammalian myosin VII has a tail with 2 MyTH4 domains, 2 FERM domains, and a SH3 domain. The catalytic (head) domain has ATPase activity and belongs to the larger group of P-loop NTPases. Myosins are actin-dependent molecular motors that play important roles in muscle contraction, cell motility, and organelle transport. The head domain is a molecular motor, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate directed movement toward the plus end along actin filaments. A cyclical interaction between myosin and actin provides the driving force. Rates of ATP hydrolysis and consequently the speed of movement along actin filaments vary widely, from about 0.04 micrometer per second for myosin I to 4.5 micrometer per second for myosin II in skeletal muscle. Myosin II moves in discrete steps about 5-10 nm long and generates 1-5 piconewtons of force. Upon ATP binding, the myosin head dissociates from an actin filament. ATP hydrolysis causes the head to pivot and associate with a new actin subunit. The release of Pi causes the head to pivot and move the filament (power stroke). Release of ADP completes the cycle. CyMoBase classifications were used to confirm and identify the myosins in this hierarchy. .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | gnl|CDD|276832 |    3333 | 0            |      79 |   748 |      670 |\n",

These myosins possess an extended neck with multiple IQ motifs such as found in class V, VIII, XI, and XIII myosins. These myosins are defined by two tandem MyTH4 and FERM domains. The apicomplexan, but not diatom myosins contain 4-6 WD40 repeats near the end of the C-terminal tail which suggests a possible function of these myosins in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. The catalytic (head) domain has ATPase activity and belongs to the larger group of P-loop NTPases. Myosins are actin-dependent molecular motors that play important roles in muscle contraction, cell motility, and organelle transport. The head domain is a molecular motor, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate directed movement toward the plus end along actin filaments. A cyclical interaction between myosin and actin provides the driving force. Rates of ATP hydrolysis and consequently the speed of movement along actin filaments vary widely, from about 0.04 micrometer per second for myosin I to 4.5 micrometer per second for myosin II in skeletal muscle. Myosin II moves in discrete steps about 5-10 nm long and generates 1-5 piconewtons of force. Upon ATP binding, the myosin head dissociates from an actin filament. ATP hydrolysis causes the head to pivot and associate with a new actin subunit. The release of Pi causes the head to pivot and move the filament (power stroke). Release of ADP completes the cycle.

Myo5, also called heavy chain 12, myoxin, are dimeric myosins that transport a variety of intracellular cargo processively along actin filaments, such as melanosomes, synaptic vesicles, vacuoles, and mRNA. The catalytic (head) domain has ATPase activity and belongs to the larger group of P-loop NTPases. It also contains a IQ domain and a globular DIL domain. Myosin V is a class of actin-based motor proteins involved in cytoplasmic vesicle transport and anchorage, spindle-pole alignment and mRNA translocation. The protein encoded by this gene is abundant in melanocytes and nerve cells. Mutations in this gene cause Griscelli syndrome type-1 (GS1), Griscelli syndrome type-3 (GS3) and neuroectodermal melanolysosomal disease, or Elejalde disease. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been reported, but the full-length nature of some variants has not been determined. Myosins are actin-dependent molecular motors that play important roles in muscle contraction, cell motility, and organelle transport. The head domain is a molecular motor, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate directed movement toward the plus end along actin filaments. A cyclical interaction between myosin and actin provides the driving force. Rates of ATP hydrolysis and consequently the speed of movement along actin filaments vary widely, from about 0.04 micrometer per second for myosin I to 4.5 micrometer per second for myosin II in skeletal muscle. Myosin II moves in discrete steps about 5-10 nm long and generates 1-5 piconewtons of force. Upon ATP binding, the myosin head dissociates from an actin filament. ATP hydrolysis causes the head to pivot and associate with a new actin subunit. The release of Pi causes the head to pivot and move the filament (power stroke). Release of ADP completes the cycle.

Class II myosins, also called conventional myosins, are the myosin type responsible for producing actomyosin contraction in metazoan muscle and non-muscle cells. Myosin II contains two heavy chains made up of the head (N-terminal) and tail (C-terminal) domains with a coiled-coil morphology that holds the two heavy chains together. Thus, myosin II has two heads. The intermediate neck domain is the region creating the angle between the head and tail. It also contains 4 light chains which bind the heavy chains in the \"neck\" region between the head and tail. The head domain is a molecular motor, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate directed movement toward the plus end along actin filaments. Class-II myosins are regulated by phosphorylation of the myosin light chain or by binding of Ca2+. A cyclical interaction between myosin and actin provides the driving force. Upon ATP binding, the myosin head dissociates from an actin filament. ATP hydrolysis causes the head to pivot and associate with a new actin subunit.

Myosin VI is a monomeric myosin, which moves towards the minus-end of actin filaments, in contrast to most other myosins which moves towards the plus-end of actin filaments. It is thought that myosin VI, unlike plus-end directed myosins, does not use a pure lever arm mechanism, but instead steps with a mechanism analogous to the kinesin neck-linker uncoupling model. It has been implicated in a myriad of functions including: the transport of cytoplasmic organelles, maintenance of normal Golgi morphology, endocytosis, secretion, cell migration, border cell migration during development, and in cancer metastasis playing roles in deafness and retinal development among others. While how this is accomplished is largely unknown there are several interacting proteins that have been identified such as disabled homolog 2 (DAB2), GIPC1, synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97; also known as DLG1) and optineurin, which have been found to target myosin VI to different cellular compartments. The catalytic (head) domain has ATPase activity and belongs to the larger group of P-loop NTPases. Myosins are actin-dependent molecular motors that play important roles in muscle contraction, cell motility, and organelle transport. The head domain is a molecular motor, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate directed movement toward the minus end along actin filaments.

Myosin motor domain of type IIa skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain 2 (also called MYH2A, MYHSA2, MyHC-IIa, MYHas8, MyHC-2A) in insects and mollusks. This gene encodes a member of the class II or conventional myosin heavy chains, and functions in skeletal muscle contraction. Mutations in this gene results in inclusion body myopathy-3 and familial congenital myopathy. Class II myosins, also called conventional myosins, are the myosin type responsible for producing actomyosin contraction in metazoan muscle and non-muscle cells. Myosin II contains two heavy chains made up of the head (N-terminal) and tail (C-terminal) domains with a coiled-coil morphology that holds the two heavy chains together. The intermediate neck domain is the region creating the angle between the head and tail. It also contains 4 light chains which bind the heavy chains in the \"neck\" region between the head and tail. The head domain is a molecular motor, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate directed movement toward the plus end along actin filaments. Class-II myosins are regulated by phosphorylation of the myosin light chain or by binding of Ca2+. A cyclical interaction between myosin and actin provides the driving force. Upon ATP binding, the myosin head dissociates from an actin filament. ATP hydrolysis causes the head to pivot and associate with a new actin subunit. The release of Pi causes the head to pivot and move the filament (power stroke). Release of ADP completes the cycle.

Myosins are actin-dependent molecular motors that play important roles in muscle contraction, cell motility, and organelle transport. The head domain is a molecular motor, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate directed movement toward the plus end along actin filaments. A cyclical interaction between myosin and actin provides the driving force. Rates of ATP hydrolysis and consequently the speed of movement along actin filaments vary widely, from about 0.04 micrometer per second for myosin I to 4.5 micrometer per second for myosin II in skeletal muscle. Myosin II moves in discrete steps about 5-10 nm long and generates 1-5 piconewtons of force. Upon ATP binding, the myosin head dissociates from an actin filament. ATP hydrolysis causes the head to pivot and associate with a new actin subunit. The release of Pi causes the head to pivot and move the filament (power stroke). Release of ADP completes the cycle. CyMoBase classifications were used to confirm and identify the myosins in this hierarchy. .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | gnl|CDD|276846 |    1192 | 7.6229e-144  |      79 |   747 |      686 |\n",

The gene product is a subunit of a hexameric protein that consists of two heavy chain subunits and two pairs of non-identical light chain subunits. It functions as a major contractile protein, converting chemical energy into mechanical energy through the hydrolysis of ATP. The gene encoding a human ortholog of rat NUDE1 is transcribed from the reverse strand of this gene, and its 3' end overlaps with that of the latter. Inversion of the MYH11 locus is one of the most frequent chromosomal aberrations found in acute myeloid leukemia. Alternative splicing generates isoforms that are differentially expressed, with ratios changing during muscle cell maturation. Mutations in MYH11 have been described in individuals with thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections with patent ductus arteriosus. MYH11 mutations are also thought to contribute to human colorectal cancer and are also associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The mutations found in human intestinal neoplasia result in unregulated proteins with constitutive motor activity, similar to the mutant myh11 zebrafish. Class II myosins, also called conventional myosins, are the myosin type responsible for producing actomyosin contraction in metazoan muscle and non-muscle cells. Myosin II contains two heavy chains made up of the head (N-terminal) and tail (C-terminal) domains with a coiled-coil morphology that holds the two heavy chains together. The intermediate neck domain is the region creating the angle between the head and tail. It also contains 4 light chains which bind the heavy chains in the \"neck\" region between the head and tail. The head domain is a molecular motor, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate directed movement toward the plus end along actin filaments. Class-II myosins are regulated by phosphorylation of the myosin light chain or by binding of Ca2+. A cyclical interaction between myosin and actin provides the driving force. Upon ATP binding, the myosin head dissociates from an actin filament. ATP hydrolysis causes the head to pivot and associate with a new actin subunit. The release of Pi causes the head to pivot and move the filament (power stroke). Release of ADP completes the cycle.

Cardiac muscle myosin is a hexamer consisting of two heavy chain subunits, two light chain subunits, and two regulatory subunits. This gene encodes the alpha heavy chain subunit of cardiac myosin. Mutations in this gene cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and atrial septal defect. Class II myosins, also called conventional myosins, are the myosin type responsible for producing actomyosin contraction in metazoan muscle and non-muscle cells. Myosin II contains two heavy chains made up of the head (N-terminal) and tail (C-terminal) domains with a coiled-coil morphology that holds the two heavy chains together. The intermediate neck domain is the region creating the angle between the head and tail. It also contains 4 light chains which bind the heavy chains in the \"neck\" region between the head and tail. The head domain is a molecular motor, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate directed movement toward the plus end along actin filaments. Class-II myosins are regulated by phosphorylation of the myosin light chain or by binding of Ca2+. A cyclical interaction between myosin and actin provides the driving force. Upon ATP binding, the myosin head dissociates from an actin filament. ATP hydrolysis causes the head to pivot and associate with a new actin subunit.

Class II myosins, also called conventional myosins, are the myosin type responsible for producing actomyosin contraction in metazoan muscle and non-muscle cells. Myosin II contains two heavy chains made up of the head (N-terminal) and tail (C-terminal) domains with a coiled-coil morphology that holds the two heavy chains together. The intermediate neck domain is the region creating the angle between the head and tail. It also contains 4 light chains which bind the heavy chains in the \"neck\" region between the head and tail. The head domain is a molecular motor, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate directed movement toward the plus end along actin filaments. Class-II myosins are regulated by phosphorylation of the myosin light chain or by binding of Ca2+. A cyclical interaction between myosin and actin provides the driving force. Upon ATP binding, the myosin head dissociates from an actin filament. ATP hydrolysis causes the head to pivot and associate with a new actin subunit. The release of Pi causes the head to pivot and move the filament (power stroke). Release of ADP completes the cycle. Some of the data used for this classification were produced by the CyMoBase team at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry. The sequence names are composed of the species abbreviation followed by the protein abbreviation and optional protein classifier and variant designations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | gnl|CDD|276893 |    1112 | 9.43279e-133 |      79 |   748 |      686 |\n",

It works in opposition to dynein, contributing to the retention of Mcs1 vesicles at the site of cell growth and increasing vesicle fusion necessary for polarized growth. Class 17 myosins consist of a N-terminal myosin motor domain with Cyt-b5, chitin synthase 2, and a DEK_C domains at it C-terminus.  The chitin synthase region contains several transmembrane domains by which myosin 17 is thought to bind secretory vesicles.

CyMoBase classifications were used to confirm and identify the myosins in this hierarchy. .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | gnl|CDD|276858 |     714 | 3.01697e-79  |      82 |   747 |      753 |\n",

      "|  72 | gnl|CDD|270020 cd13199, FERM_C2_MyoVII, FERM domain C-lobe, repeat 2, of Myosin VII (MyoVII, Myo7).  MyoVII, a MyTH-FERM myosin, is an actin-based motor protein essential for a variety of biological processes in the actin cytoskeleton function. Mutations in MyoVII leads to problems in sensory perception: deafness and blindness in humans (Usher Syndrome), retinal defects and deafness in mice (shaker 1), and aberrant auditory and vestibular function in zebrafish. Myosin VIIAs have plus (barbed) end-directed motor activity on actin filaments and a characteristic actin-activated ATPase activity. MyoVII consists of a conserved spectrin-like, SH3 subdomain N-terminal region, a motor/head region, a neck made of 4-5 IQ motifs, and a tail consisting of a coiled-coil domain, followed by a tandem repeat of myosin tail homology 4 (MyTH4) domains and partial FERM domains that are separated by an SH3 subdomain and are thought to mediate dimerization and binding to other proteins or cargo. Members include: MyoVIIa, MyoVIIb, and MyoVII members that do not have distinct myosin VIIA and myosin VIIB genes. The FERM domain has a cloverleaf tripart structure composed of: (1) FERM_N (A-lobe or F1); (2) FERM_M (B-lobe, or F2); and (3) FERM_C (C-lobe or F3). The C-lobe/F3 within the FERM domain is part of the PH domain family. The FERM domain is found in the cytoskeletal-associated proteins such as ezrin, moesin, radixin, 4.1R, and merlin. These proteins provide a link between the membrane and cytoskeleton and are involved in signal transduction pathways. The FERM domain is also found in protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), the tyrosine kinases FAK and JAK, in addition to other proteins involved in signaling. This domain is structurally similar to the PH and PTB domains and consequently is capable of binding to both peptides and phospholipids at different sites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | gnl|CDD|270020 |     498 | 3.78352e-58  |    2005 |  2100 |       96 |\n",
      "|  73 | gnl|CDD|276898 cd14938, MYSc_Myo24B, class XXIV B myosin, motor domain.  These myosins have a 1-2 IQ motifs in their neck and a coiled-coil region in their C-terminal tail. The functions of these myosins remain elusive. The catalytic (head) domain has ATPase activity and belongs to the larger group of P-loop NTPases. Myosins are actin-dependent molecular motors that play important roles in muscle contraction, cell motility, and organelle transport. The head domain is a molecular motor, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate directed movement toward the plus end along actin filaments. A cyclical interaction between myosin and actin provides the driving force. Rates of ATP hydrolysis and consequently the speed of movement along actin filaments vary widely, from about 0.04 micrometer per second for myosin I to 4.5 micrometer per second for myosin II in skeletal muscle. Myosin II moves in discrete steps about 5-10 nm long and generates 1-5 piconewtons of force. Upon ATP binding, the myosin head dissociates from an actin filament. ATP hydrolysis causes the head to pivot and associate with a new actin subunit. The release of Pi causes the head to pivot and move the filament (power stroke). Release of ADP completes the cycle. CyMoBase classifications were used to confirm and identify the myosins in this hierarchy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | gnl|CDD|276898 |     544 | 1.98796e-57  |      81 |   747 |      743 |\n",

MyoVII, a MyTH-FERM myosin, is an actin-based motor protein essential for a variety of biological processes in the actin cytoskeleton function. Mutations in MyoVII leads to problems in sensory perception: deafness and blindness in humans (Usher Syndrome), retinal defects and deafness in mice (shaker 1), and aberrant auditory and vestibular function in zebrafish. Myosin VIIAs have plus (barbed) end-directed motor activity on actin filaments and a characteristic actin-activated ATPase activity. MyoVII consists of a conserved spectrin-like, SH3 subdomain N-terminal region, a motor/head region, a neck made of 4-5 IQ motifs, and a tail consisting of a coiled-coil domain, followed by a tandem repeat of myosin tail homology 4 (MyTH4) domains and partial FERM domains that are separated by an SH3 subdomain and are thought to mediate dimerization and binding to other proteins or cargo. Members include: MyoVIIa, MyoVIIb, and MyoVII members that do not have distinct myosin VIIA and myosin VIIB genes. The FERM domain has a cloverleaf tripart structure composed of: (1) FERM_N (A-lobe or F1); (2) FERM_M (B-lobe, or F2); and (3) FERM_C (C-lobe or F3). The C-lobe/F3 within the FERM domain is part of the PH domain family. The FERM domain is found in the cytoskeletal-associated proteins such as ezrin, moesin, radixin, 4.1R, and merlin. These proteins provide a link between the membrane and cytoskeleton and are involved in signal transduction pathways. The FERM domain is also found in protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) , the tyrosine kinases FAK and JAK, in addition to other proteins involved in signaling. This domain is structurally similar to the PH and PTB domains and consequently is capable of binding to both peptides and phospholipids at different sites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | gnl|CDD|270019 |     317 | 8.87271e-34  |    1403 |  1499 |       99 |\n",

      "|  86 | gnl|CDD|276859 cd14894, MYSc_Myo33, class myosin, motor domain.  Class XXXIII myosins have variable numbers of IQ domain and 2 tandem ANK repeats that are separated by a PH domain. The myosin classes XXX to XXXIV contain members from Phytophthora species and Hyaloperonospora parasitica. The catalytic (head) domain has ATPase activity and belongs to the larger group of P-loop NTPases. Myosins are actin-dependent molecular motors that play important roles in muscle contraction, cell motility, and organelle transport. The head domain is a molecular motor, which utilizes ATP hydrolysis to generate directed movement toward the plus end along actin filaments. A cyclical interaction between myosin and actin provides the driving force. Rates of ATP hydrolysis and consequently the speed of movement along actin filaments vary widely, from about 0.04 micrometer per second for myosin I to 4.5 micrometer per second for myosin II in skeletal muscle. Myosin II moves in discrete steps about 5-10 nm long and generates 1-5 piconewtons of force. Upon ATP binding, the myosin head dissociates from an actin filament. ATP hydrolysis causes the head to pivot and associate with a new actin subunit. The release of Pi causes the head to pivot and move the filament (power stroke). Release of ADP completes the cycle.

The family corresponds to the F1 sub-domain, which is also called the N-terminal ubiquitin-like structural domain of the FERM domain (FERM_N), which is structurally similar to ubiquitin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | gnl|CDD|340464 |     128 | 2.3238e-08   |    1796 |  1890 |       95 |\n",

It is required for sensory function in both Drosophila and mammals. Mutations in the Myo7A gene cause both syndromic deaf-blindness [Usher syndrome I (USH1)] and nonsyndromic (DFNB2 and DFNA11) deafness in humans. It contains an N-terminal motor domain, light chain-binding IQ motifs, a coiled-coil region for heavy chain dimerization, and a tail consisting of a pair of MyTH4-FERM tandems separated by a SH3 domain. SH3 domains bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity, preferentially to PxxP motifs; they play a role in the regulation of enzymes by intramolecular interactions, changing the subcellular localization of signal pathway components and mediate multiprotein complex assemblies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | gnl|CDD|212814 |     132 | 2.61461e-09  |    1500 |  1560 |       63 |\n",

This domain is structurally similar to the PH and PTB domains and consequently is capable of binding to both peptides and phospholipids at different sites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | gnl|CDD|270024 |     107 | 1.8993e-05   |    2005 |  2053 |       49 |\n",

Myosin XVa is an unconventional myosin that is critical for the normal growth of mechanosensory stereocilia of inner ear hair cells. Mutations in the myosin XVa gene are associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss. Myosin XVa contains a unique N-terminal extension followed by a motor domain, light chain-binding IQ motifs, and a tail consisting of a pair of MyTH4-FERM tandems separated by a SH3 domain, and a PDZ domain. SH3 domains bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity, preferentially to PxxP motifs; they play a role in the regulation of enzymes by intramolecular interactions, changing the subcellular localization of signal pathway components and mediate multiprotein complex assemblies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | gnl|CDD|212817 |      93 | 0.00051835   |    1502 |  1558 |       57 |\n",

Myosin-X, also termed myosin-10 (Myo10), is an untraditional member of myosin superfamily. It is an actin-based motor protein that plays a critical role in diverse cellular motile events, such as filopodia formation/extension, phagocytosis, cell migration, and mitotic spindle maintenance, as well as a number of disease states including cancer metastasis and pathogen infection. Myosin-X functions as an important regulator of cytoskeleton that modulates cell motilities in many different cellular contexts. It regulates neuronal radial migration through interacting with N-cadherin. Like other unconventional myosins, Myosin-X is composed of a conserved motor head, a neck region and a variable tail. The neck region consists of three IQ motifs (light chain-binding sites), and a predicted stalk of coiled coil. The tail contains three PEST regions, three PH domains, a MyTH4 domain, and a FERM domain. The FERM domain is made up of three sub-domains, F1, F2, and F3. This family corresponds to the F1 sub-domain, which is also called the N-terminal ubiquitin-like structural domain of the FERM domain (FERM_N).

DdMyo7, also termed Myosin-I heavy chain, or class VII unconventional myosin, or M7, plays a role in adhesion in Dictyostelium where it is a component of a complex of proteins that serve to link membrane receptors to the underlying actin cytoskeleton. It interacts with talinA, an actin-binding protein with a known role in cell-substrate adhesion. DdMyo7 is required for phagocytosis. It is also essential for the extension of filopodia, plasma membrane protrusions filled with parallel bundles of F-actin. Members in this family contain a myosin motor domain, two MyTH4 domains, two FERM (Band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domains, and two Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. Some family members contain an extra SH3 domain. Each FERM domain is made up of three sub-domains, F1, F2, and F3. This family corresponds to the F1 sub-domain, which is also called the N-terminal ubiquitin-like structural domain of the FERM domain (FERM_N).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | gnl|CDD|340728 |      96 | 0.000639634  |    1203 |  1287 |       92 |\n",
      "| 107 | gnl|CDD|269973 cd10569, FERM_C_Talin, FERM domain C-lobe/F3 of Talin.  Talin (also called filopodin) plays an important role in initiating actin filament growth in motile cell protrusions. It is responsible for linking the cytoplasmic domains of integrins to the actin-based cytoskeleton, and is involved in vinculin, integrin and actin interactions. At the leading edge of motile cells, talin colocalises with the hyaluronan receptor layilin in transient adhesions, some of which become more stable focal adhesions (FA). During this maturation process, layilin is replaced with integrins, where localized production of PI(4,5)P(2) by type 1 phosphatidyl inositol phosphate kinase type 1gamma (PIPK1gamma) is thought to play a role in FA assembly. Talins are composed of a N-terminal region FERM domain which us made up of 3 subdomains (N, alpha-, and C-lobe; or- A-lobe, B-lobe, and C-lobe; or F1, F2, and F3) connected by short linkers, a talin rod which binds vinculin, and a conserved C-terminal region with actin- and integrin-binding sites. There are 2 additional actin-binding domains, one in the talin rod and the other in the FERM domain. Both the F2 and F3 FERM subdomains contribute to F-actin binding. Subdomain F3 of the FERM domain contains overlapping binding sites for integrin cytoplasmic domains and for the type 1 gamma isoform of PIP-kinase (phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase). The FERM domain has a cloverleaf tripart structure . F3 within the FERM domain is part of the PH domain family. The FERM domain is found in the cytoskeletal-associated proteins such as ezrin, moesin, radixin, 4.1R, and merlin. These proteins provide a link between the membrane and cytoskeleton and are involved in signal transduction pathways. The FERM domain is also found in protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) , the tyrosine kinases FAK and JAK, in addition to other proteins involved in signaling. This domain is structurally similar to the PH and PTB domains and consequently is capable of binding to both peptides and phospholipids at different sites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | gnl|CDD|269973 |      95 | 0.000704557  |    2005 |  2096 |       93 |\n",

      "| 109 | gnl|CDD|212692 cd11758, SH3_CRK_N, N-terminal Src Homology 3 domain of Ct10 Regulator of Kinase adaptor proteins.  CRK adaptor proteins consists of SH2 and SH3 domains, which bind tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides and proline-rich motifs, respectively. They function downstream of protein tyrosine kinases in many signaling pathways started by various extracellular signals, including growth and differentiation factors. Cellular CRK (c-CRK) contains a single SH2 domain, followed by N-terminal and C-terminal SH3 domains. It is involved in the regulation of many cellular processes including cell growth, motility, adhesion, and apoptosis. CRK has been implicated in the malignancy of various human cancers. The N-terminal SH3 domain of CRK binds a number of target proteins including DOCK180, C3G, SOS, and cABL. The CRK family includes two alternatively spliced protein forms, CRKI and CRKII, that are expressed by the CRK gene, and the CRK-like (CRKL) protein, which is expressed by a distinct gene (CRKL). SH3 domains are protein interaction domains that bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity, preferentially to PxxP motifs.

      "| 114 | gnl|CDD|213224 cd03257, ABC_NikE_OppD_transporters, ATP-binding cassette domain of nickel/oligopeptides specific transporters.  The ABC transporter subfamily specific for the transport of dipeptides, oligopeptides (OppD), and nickel (NikDE). The NikABCDE system of E. coli belongs to this family and is composed of the periplasmic binding protein NikA, two integral membrane components (NikB and NikC), and two ATPase (NikD and NikE). The NikABCDE transporter is synthesized under anaerobic conditions to meet the increased demand for nickel resulting from hydrogenase synthesis. The molecular mechanism of nickel uptake in many bacteria and most archaea is not known. Many other members of this ABC family are also involved in the uptake of dipeptides and oligopeptides. The oligopeptide transport system (Opp) is a five-component ABC transport composed of a membrane-anchored substrate binding proteins (SRP), OppA, two transmembrane proteins, OppB and OppC, and two ATP-binding domains, OppD and OppF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | gnl|CDD|213224 |      97 | 0.00398699   |     113 |   181 |       69 |\n",

Proteins in this family include IRSp53, BAIAP2L1, BAIAP2L2, and similar proteins. They all contain an Inverse-Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (I-BAR) or IMD domain in addition to the SH3 domain. IRSp53, also known as BAIAP2, is a scaffolding protein that takes part in many signaling pathways including Cdc42-induced filopodia formation, Rac-mediated lamellipodia extension, and spine morphogenesis. IRSp53 exists as multiple splicing variants that differ mainly at the C-termini. BAIAP2L1, also called IRTKS (Insulin Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Substrate), serves as a substrate for the insulin receptor and binds the small GTPase Rac. It plays a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and colocalizes with F-actin, cortactin, VASP, and vinculin. IRSp53 and IRTKS also mediate the recruitment of effector proteins Tir and EspFu, which regulate host cell actin reorganization, to bacterial attachment sites. BAIAP2L2 co-localizes with clathrin plaques but its function has not been determined. The SH3 domains of IRSp53 and IRTKS have been shown to bind the proline-rich C-terminus of EspFu. SH3 domains are protein interaction domains that bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity, preferentially to PxxP motifs. They play versatile and diverse roles in the cell including the regulation of enzymes, changing the subcellular localization of signaling pathway components, and mediating the formation of multiprotein complex assemblies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | gnl|CDD|212713 |      87 | 0.0043847    |    1511 |  1563 |       56 |\n",

Src subfamily members include Src, Lck, Hck, Blk, Lyn, Fgr, Fyn, Yrk, Yes, and Brk. Src (or c-Src) proteins are cytoplasmic (or non-receptor) PTKs which are anchored to the plasma membrane. They contain an N-terminal SH4 domain with a myristoylation site, followed by SH3 and SH2 domains, a tyr kinase domain, and a regulatory C-terminal region containing a conserved tyr. They are activated by autophosphorylation at the tyr kinase domain, but are negatively regulated by phosphorylation at the C-terminal tyr by Csk (C-terminal Src Kinase). However, Brk lacks the N-terminal myristoylation sites. Src proteins are involved in signaling pathways that regulate cytokine and growth factor responses, cytoskeleton dynamics, cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. They were identified as the first proto-oncogene products, and they regulate cell adhesion, invasion, and motility in cancer cells, and tumor vasculature, contributing to cancer progression and metastasis. Src kinases are overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, making them attractive targets for therapy. They are also implicated in acute inflammatory responses and osteoclast function. Src, Fyn, Yes, and Yrk are widely expressed, while Blk, Lck, Hck, Fgr, Lyn, and Brk show a limited expression pattern. This subfamily also includes Drosophila Src42A, Src oncogene at 42A (also known as Dsrc41) which accumulates at sites of cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion, and participates in Drosphila development and wound healing. It has been shown to promote tube elongation in the tracheal system, is essential for proper cell-cell matching during dorsal closure, and regulates cell-cell contacts in developing Drosophila eyes.

Nebulin is a giant filamentous protein (600-900 kD) that is expressed abundantly in skeletal muscle. It binds to actin thin filaments and regulates its assembly and function. Nebulin was thought to be part of a molecular ruler complex that is critical in determining the lengths of actin thin filaments in skeletal muscle since its length, which varies due to alternative splicing, correlates with the length of thin filaments in various muscle types. Recent studies indicate that nebulin regulates thin filament length by stabilizing the filaments and preventing depolymerization. Mutations in nebulin can cause nemaline myopathy, characterized by muscle weakness which can be severe and can lead to neonatal lethality. Nebulin contains an N-terminal LIM domain, many nebulin repeats/super repeats, and a C-terminal SH3 domain. SH3 domains are protein interaction domains that bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity, preferentially to PxxP motifs. They play versatile and diverse roles in the cell including the regulation of enzymes, changing the subcellular localization of signaling pathway components, and mediating the formation of multiprotein complex assemblies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | gnl|CDD|212866 |      84 | 0.00874352   |    1505 |  1562 |       58 |\n",

      "| 121 | gnl|CDD|212703 cd11769, SH3_CSK, Src Homology 3 domain of C-terminal Src kinase.  CSK is a cytoplasmic (or nonreceptor) tyr kinase containing the Src homology domains, SH3 and SH2, N-terminal to the catalytic tyr kinase domain. They negatively regulate the activity of Src kinases that are anchored to the plasma membrane. To inhibit Src kinases, CSK is translocated to the membrane via binding to specific transmembrane proteins, G-proteins, or adaptor proteins near the membrane. CSK catalyzes the tyr phosphorylation of the regulatory C-terminal tail of Src kinases, resulting in their inactivation. It is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and plays a role, as a regulator of Src, in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, and consequently, in cancer development and progression. In addition, CSK also shows Src-independent functions. It is a critical component in G-protein signaling, and plays a role in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell migration.

      "| 135 | gnl|CDD|212792 cd11858, SH3_Myosin-I_fungi, Src homology 3 domain of Type I fungal Myosins.  Type I myosins (myosin-I) are actin-dependent motors in endocytic actin structures and actin patches. They play roles in membrane traffic in endocytic and secretory pathways, cell motility, and mechanosensing. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two myosins-I, Myo3 and Myo5, which are involved in endocytosis and the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. Myosin-I contains an N-terminal actin-activated ATPase, a phospholipid-binding TH1 (tail homology 1) domain, and a C-terminal extension which includes an F-actin-binding TH2 domain, an SH3 domain, and an acidic peptide that participates in activating the Arp2/3complex. The SH3 domain of myosin-I is required for myosin-I-induced actin polymerization. SH3 domains are protein interaction domains that bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity, preferentially to PxxP motifs. They play versatile and diverse roles in the cell including the regulation of enzymes, changing the subcellular localization of signaling pathway components, and mediating the formation of multiprotein complex assemblies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | gnl|CDD|212792 |      73 | 0.264529     |    1518 |  1559 |       42 |\n",

They contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a C-terminal SH3 domain, and several tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The SH3 domain of SKAP1 is necessary for its ability to regulate T-cell conjugation with antigen-presenting cells and the formation of LFA-1 clusters. SKAP1 binds primarily to a proline-rich region of ADAP through its SH3 domain; its degradation is regulated by ADAP. A secondary interaction occurs via the ADAP SH3 domain and the RKxxYxxY motif in SKAP1. SH3 domains are protein interaction domains that bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity, preferentially to PxxP motifs. They play versatile and diverse roles in the cell including the regulation of enzymes, changing the subcellular localization of signaling pathway components, and mediating the formation of multiprotein complex assemblies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | gnl|CDD|212800 |      72 | 0.441033     |    1502 |  1559 |       58 |\n",

Src kinases contain an N-terminal SH4 domain with a myristoylation site, followed by SH3 and SH2 domains, a tyr kinase domain, and a regulatory C-terminal region containing a conserved tyr. They are activated by autophosphorylation at the tyr kinase domain, but are negatively regulated by phosphorylation at the C-terminal tyr by Csk (C-terminal Src Kinase).

NADPH oxidase catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADPH to oxygen during phagocytosis forming superoxide and reactive oxygen species. p67phox plays a regulatory role and contains N-terminal TPR, first SH3 (or N-terminal or central SH3), PB1, and C-terminal SH3 domains. It binds, via its C-terminal SH3 domain, to a proline-rich region of p47phox and upon activation, this complex assembles with flavocytochrome b558, the Nox2-p22phox heterodimer. Concurrently, RacGTP translocates to the membrane and interacts with the TPR domain of p67phox, which leads to the activation of NADPH oxidase. The PB1 domain of p67phox binds to its partner PB1 domain in p40phox, and this facilitates the assembly of p47phox-p67phox at the membrane. SH3 domains are protein interaction domains that bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity, preferentially to PxxP motifs.

      "| 149 | gnl|CDD|212709 cd11775, SH3_Sla1p_3, Third Src Homology 3 domain of the fungal endocytic adaptor protein Sla1p.  Sla1p facilitates endocytosis by playing a role as an adaptor protein in coupling components of the actin cytoskeleton to the endocytic machinery. It interacts with Abp1p, Las17p and Pan1p, which are activator proteins of actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3). Sla1p contains multiple domains including three SH3 domains, a SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain, and a Sla1 homology domain 1 (SHD1), which binds to the NPFXD motif that is found in many integral membrane proteins such as the Golgi-localized Arf-binding protein Lsb5p and the P4-ATPases, Drs2p and Dnf1p. The third SH3 domain of Sla1p can bind ubiquitin while retaining the ability to bind proline-rich ligands; monoubiquitination of target proteins signals internalization and sorting through the endocytic pathway. SH3 domains are protein interaction domains that bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity, preferentially to PxxP motifs.

This family includes tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptors PTPN14 and PTPN21, both of which are protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). They belong to the FERM family of PTPs characterized by a conserved N-terminal FERM domain and a C-terminal PTP catalytic domain with an intervening sequence containing an acidic region and a putative SH3 domain-binding sequence.  The FERM domain is made up of three sub-domains, F1, F2, and F3. This family corresponds to the F1 sub-domain, which is also called the N-terminal ubiquitin-like structural domain of the FERM domain (FERM_N). PTPN14 plays a role in the nucleus during cell proliferation. PTPN21 interacts with a Tec tyrosine kinase family member, the epithelial and endothelial tyrosine kinase (Etk, also known as Bmx), modulates Stat3 activation, and plays a role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | gnl|CDD|340619 |      71 | 1.33157      |    1196 |  1239 |       44 |\n",
      "| 155 | gnl|CDD|212941 cd12008, SH3_Src, Src homology 3 domain of Src Protein Tyrosine Kinase.  Src (or c-Src) is a cytoplasmic (or non-receptor) PTK and is the vertebrate homolog of the oncogenic protein (v-Src) from Rous sarcoma virus. Together with other Src subfamily proteins, it is involved in signaling pathways that regulate cytokine and growth factor responses, cytoskeleton dynamics, cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Src also play a role in regulating cell adhesion, invasion, and motility in cancer cells, and tumor vasculature, contributing to cancer progression and metastasis. Elevated levels of Src kinase activity have been reported in a variety of human cancers. Several inhibitors of Src have been developed as anti-cancer drugs. Src is also implicated in acute inflammatory responses and osteoclast function. Src kinases contain an N-terminal SH4 domain with a myristoylation site, followed by SH3 and SH2 domains, a tyr kinase domain, and a regulatory C-terminal region containing a conserved tyr. They are activated by autophosphorylation at the tyr kinase domain, but are negatively regulated by phosphorylation at the C-terminal tyr by Csk (C-terminal Src Kinase). The SH3 domain of Src kinases contributes to substrate recruitment by binding adaptor proteins/substrates, and regulation of kinase activity through an intramolecular interaction. SH3 domains are protein interaction domains that bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity, preferentially to PxxP motifs. They play versatile and diverse roles in the cell including the regulation of enzymes, changing the subcellular localization of signaling pathway components, and mediating the formation of multiprotein complex assemblies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | gnl|CDD|212941 |      67 | 1.38547      |    1507 |  1564 |       59 |\n",

This domain was initially shown to bind peptides with a NPXY motif with differing requirements for phosphorylation of the tyrosine, although more recent studies have found that some types of PTB domains can bind to peptides lack tyrosine residues altogether. In contrast to SH2 domains, which recognize phosphotyrosine and adjacent carboxy-terminal residues, PTB-domain binding specificity is conferred by residues amino-terminal to the phosphotyrosine. PTB domains are classified into three groups: phosphotyrosine-dependent Shc-like, phosphotyrosine-dependent IRS-like, and phosphotyrosine-independent Dab-like PTB domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | gnl|CDD|269911 |      72 | 1.47064      |    2027 |  2057 |       31 |\n",

      "| 162 | gnl|CDD|212743 cd11809, SH3_srGAP, Src homology 3 domain of Slit-Robo GTPase Activating Proteins.  Slit-Robo GTPase Activating Proteins (srGAPs) are Rho GAPs that interact with Robo1, the transmembrane receptor of Slit proteins. Slit proteins are secreted proteins that control axon guidance and the migration of neurons and leukocytes. Vertebrates contain three isoforms of srGAPs (srGAP1-3), all of which are expressed during embryonic and early development in the nervous system but with different localization and timing. A fourth member has also been reported (srGAP4, also called ARHGAP4). srGAPs contain an N-terminal F-BAR domain, a Rho GAP domain, and a C-terminal SH3 domain. SH3 domains are protein interaction domains that bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity, preferentially to PxxP motifs. They play versatile and diverse roles in the cell including the regulation of enzymes, changing the subcellular localization of signaling pathway components, and mediating the formation of multiprotein complex assemblies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | gnl|CDD|212743 |      67 | 1.68121      |    1518 |  1555 |       38 |\n",

BAIAP2L1 or IRTKS is widely expressed, serves as a substrate for the insulin receptor, and binds the small GTPase Rac. It plays a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and colocalizes with F-actin, cortactin, VASP, and vinculin. BAIAP2L1 expression leads to the formation of short actin bundles, distinct from filopodia-like protrusions induced by the expression of the related protein IRSp53. IRTKS mediates the recruitment of effector proteins Tir and EspFu, which regulate host cell actin reorganization, to bacterial attachment sites. It contains an N-terminal IMD or Inverse-Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (I-BAR) domain, an SH3 domain, and a WASP homology 2 (WH2) actin-binding motif at the C-terminus. The SH3 domain of IRTKS has been shown to bind the proline-rich C-terminus of EspFu.

Endophilins play roles in synaptic vesicle formation, virus budding, mitochondrial morphology maintenance, receptor-mediated endocytosis inhibition, and endosomal sorting. They are classified into two types, A and B. Vertebrates contain three endophilin-A isoforms (A1, A2, and A3). Endophilin-A proteins are enriched in the brain and play multiple roles in receptor-mediated endocytosis. They tubulate membranes and regulate calcium influx into neurons to trigger the activation of the endocytic machinery. They are also involved in the sorting of plasma membrane proteins, actin filament assembly, and the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles for fusion with endosomes. Endophilins contain an N-terminal N-BAR domain (BAR domain with an additional N-terminal amphipathic helix), followed by a variable region containing proline clusters, and a C-terminal SH3 domain. SH3 domains are protein interaction domains that bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity, preferentially to PxxP motifs. They play versatile and diverse roles in the cell including the regulation of enzymes, changing the subcellular localization of signaling pathway components, and mediating the formation of multiprotein complex assemblies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | gnl|CDD|212737 |      66 | 3.33252      |    1518 |  1555 |       38 |\n",

The recruitment of Fermitin proteins and Talin to the membrane mediates the terminal event of integrin signalling, via interaction with integrin beta subunits. Fermatin has FERM domain interrupted with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Fermitin family homologs (Fermt1, 2, and 3, also known as Kindlins) are each encoded by a different gene. In mammalian studies, Fermt1 is generally expressed in epithelial cells, Fermt2 is expressed inmuscle tissues, and Fermt3 is expressed in hematopoietic lineages. Specifically Fermt2 is expressed in smooth and striated muscle tissues in mice and in the somites (a trunk muscle precursor) and neural crest in Xenopus embryos. As such it has been proposed that Fermt2 plays a role in cardiomyocyte and neural crest differentiation. Expression of mammalian Fermt3 is associated with hematopoietic lineages: the anterior ventral blood islands, vitelline veins, and early myeloid cells. In Xenopus embryos this expression, also include the notochord and cement gland. The FERM domain has a cloverleaf tripart structure composed of: (1) FERM_N (A-lobe or F1); (2) FERM_M (B-lobe, or F2); and (3) FERM_C (C-lobe or F3). This cd is not included in the C-lobe hierarchy based on its position in the tree. One thing to note is that unlike the other members of the C-lobe hierarchy it contains 2 FERM M domains which might also reflect a difference in its evolutionary history. The C-lobe/F3 within the FERM domain is part of the PH domain family. The FERM domain is found in the cytoskeletal-associated proteins such as ezrin, moesin, radixin, 4.1R, and merlin. These proteins provide a link between the membrane and cytoskeleton and are involved in signal transduction pathways. The FERM domain is also found in protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), the tyrosine kinases FAK and JAK, in addition to other proteins involved in signaling. This domain is structurally similar to the PH and PTB domains and consequently is capable of binding to both peptides and phospholipids at different sites.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | gnl|CDD|270026 |      67 | 4.1006       |    2004 |  2054 |       51 |\n",

Nucleoporins are the main components of the nuclear pore complex in eukaryotic cells, and mediate bidirectional nucleocytoplasmic transport, especially of mRNA and proteins. Two nucleoporin classes are known: one is characterized by the FG repeat pfam03093; the other is represented by this family, and lacks any repeats. RNA undergoing nuclear export first encounters the basket of the nuclear pore and many nucleoporins are accessible on the basket side of the pore.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | gnl|CDD|367376 |      73 | 4.715        |     726 |   833 |      111 |\n",
      "| 172 | gnl|CDD|212789 cd11855, SH3_Sho1p, Src homology 3 domain of High osmolarity signaling protein Sho1p.  Sho1p (or Sho1), also called SSU81 (Suppressor of SUA8-1 mutation), is a yeast membrane protein that regulates adaptation to high salt conditions by activating the HOG (high-osmolarity glycerol) pathway. High salt concentrations lead to the localization to the membrane of the MAPKK Pbs2, which is then activated by the MAPKK Ste11 and in turn, activates the MAPK Hog1. Pbs2 is localized to the membrane though the interaction of its PxxP motif with the SH3 domain of Sho1p. SH3 domains are protein interaction domains that bind to proline-rich ligands with moderate affinity and selectivity. They play versatile and diverse roles in the cell including the regulation of enzymes, changing the subcellular localization of signaling pathway components, and mediating the formation of multiprotein complex assemblies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | gnl|CDD|212789 |      64 | 4.84825      |    1503 |  1556 |       55 |\n",

Myosin-X, also termed myosin-10 (Myo10), is an untraditional member of myosin superfamily. It is an actin-based motor protein that plays a critical role in diverse cellular motile events, such as filopodia formation/extension, phagocytosis, cell migration, and mitotic spindle maintenance, as well as a number of disease states including cancer metastasis and pathogen infection. Myosin-X functions as an important regulator of cytoskeleton that modulates cell motilities in many different cellular contexts. It regulates neuronal radial migration through interacting with N-cadherin. Like other unconventional myosins, Myosin-X is composed of a conserved motor head, a neck region and a variable tail. The neck region consists of three IQ motifs (light chain-binding sites), and a predicted stalk of coiled coil. The tail contains three PEST regions, three PH domains, a MyTH4 domain, and a FERM domain. The FERM domain is made up of three sub-domains, F1, F2, and F3. This family corresponds to the F1 sub-domain, which is also called the N-terminal ubiquitin-like structural domain of the FERM domain (FERM_N).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | gnl|CDD|340726 |      66 | 7.84908      |    1203 |  1283 |       89 |\n",

MRL proteins share a common structural architecture, including a central structural unit consisting of a Ras-associating (RA) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an upstream coiled-coil region, and a number of polyproline motifs. RA domain-containing proteins function by interacting with Ras proteins directly or indirectly and are involved in several different functions ranging from tumor suppression to being oncoproteins. Ras proteins are small GTPases that are involved in cellular signal transduction. RA domain has the beta-grasp ubiquitin-like (Ubl) fold with low sequence similarity to ubiquitin (Ub). Ub is a protein modifier in eukaryotes that is involved in various cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and DNA repair in eukaryotes. RA and PH form a tandem domain pair (RA-PH), and serve tightly coordinated functions in both Ras GTPase signaling via the RA domain and membrane translocalization via the PH domain. MRL proteins have distinct functions in cell migration and adhesion, signaling, and in cell growth. Grb7/10/14 are multi-domain cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that are recruited to activated receptor tyrosine kinases. Grb7 and its related family members Grb10 and Grb14 share a conserved domain architecture that includes an amino-terminal proline-rich region, a central segment termed the GM region (for Grb and Mig) which includes the RA, PIR, and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, and a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain.  The tandem RA and PH domains of  Grb7/10/14 are also found in a second adaptor family, Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM) and lamellipodin, which is involved in actin-cytoskeleton rearrangement.

CYR1, also termed ATP pyrophosphate-lyase, or adenylyl cyclase, is a fungal adenylate cyclase that regulates developmental processes such as hyphal growth, biofilm formation, and phenotypic switching. CYR1 plays essential roles in regulation of cellular metabolism by catalyzing the synthesis of a second messenger, cAMP. It acts as a scaffold protein keeping Ras2 available for its regulatory factors, the Ira proteins. CYR1 has at least four domains, including an N-terminal adenylate cyclase G-alpha binding domain, a Ras-associating (RA) domain, a middle leucine-rich repeat region, and a catalytic domain. The RA domain has the beta-grasp ubiquitin-like fold with low sequence similarity to ubiquitin; ubiquitin is a protein modifier in eukaryotes that is involved in various cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and DNA repair. The RA domain of CYR1 post-translationally modifies a small GTPase called Ras, which is involved in cellular signal transduction. CYR1 activity is stimulated directly by regulatory proteins (Ras1 and Gpa2), peptidoglycan fragments and carbon dioxide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | gnl|CDD|340734 |      66 | 9.0644       |    1800 |  1843 |       44 |\n",
